- connect to GO - DONE
- support for interactive relabeling - DONE
- bulk datasets - download bulk datasets, look for evidence that it's a legit thing..., identify cell types associated with bulk datasets
    - start with mouse datasets?
- custom color scheme - DONE

- Paper mining/bio-NLP for a "literature network score"
    - there are a lot of papers that do similar things already but maybe not exactly the same thing we want...

- taking a subset of the data based on user selection, and re-run uncurl on that subset - DONE

- integrate with lineage analysis tools - visualize lineage somehow?
- better batch effect correction (models that work on larger datasets, sparse datasets)
- gene set visualization
- building a dataset of test files...


- plugin architecture (in uncurl_analysis) - won't do
- QualNorm initialization - have an option to provide a initial input file - won't do
